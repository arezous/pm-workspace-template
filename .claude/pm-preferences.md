## Communication Style Defaults

Define how you want Claude to write for different audiences. Be specific about tone,
detail level, and what to emphasize.

| Audience         | Tone & Style                              | Example                                    |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Engineering      | `[e.g., Technical, direct, data-driven]`  | "Include API details, edge cases, diagrams"|
| Leadership/Execs | `[e.g., Strategic, concise, outcome-focused]` | "Lead with impact, use bullet points"  |
| Design           | `[e.g., Collaborative, user-centric]`     | "Frame around user problems and journeys"  |
| Stakeholders     | `[e.g., Clear, jargon-free, visual]`      | "Use charts, keep to one page"             |
| Customers        | `[e.g., Empathetic, solution-oriented]`   | "Acknowledge pain points, show next steps" |

**General preferences:**
- Preferred length: `[e.g., concise — I prefer shorter docs that link to details]`
- Formatting: `[e.g., heavy use of tables, always include TL;DR at top]`
- Pronouns/voice: `[e.g., use "we" for team docs, "I" for personal updates]`

## Document Standards

What you always include in your core documents. Claude will follow these standards
when helping you draft or review.

### PRDs
- Always include: `[e.g., Problem statement, success metrics, scope boundaries, open questions]`
- Never skip: `[e.g., Non-goals section — I always define what we're NOT doing]`
- Structure preference: `[e.g., Start with user problem, then solution, then technical details]`

### Roadmaps
- Format: `[e.g., Now/Next/Later, quarterly themes, timeline-based]`
- Must include: `[e.g., Dependencies, confidence levels, stakeholder alignment status]`
- Avoid: `[e.g., Specific dates more than one quarter out]`

### Status Updates
- Frequency: `[e.g., Weekly on Fridays]`
- Format: `[e.g., Wins / Risks / Asks — three sections max]`
- Audience: `[e.g., Engineering leads + VP Product]`

### Decision Documents
- Framework: `[e.g., Options matrix with weighted criteria]`
- Must include: `[e.g., Recommendation, reversibility assessment, dissenting opinions]`

## My Writing Voice

Help Claude match the way you naturally write and communicate.

**Tone:** `[e.g., Direct but warm. I avoid corporate jargon. I use analogies to explain complex concepts.]`

**Words/phrases I use often:**
- `[e.g., "Let's unpack this", "The north star here is...", "What does success look like?"]`

**Words/phrases to avoid:**
- `[e.g., "synergy", "leverage", "circle back", "low-hanging fruit"]`

**Formatting habits:**
- `[e.g., I bold key takeaways, use numbered lists for sequences, bullet points for options]`
- `[e.g., I always end docs with "Open Questions" and "Next Steps"]`

---

## My Process

Describe how you approach product work so Claude can support your workflow.

**Discovery:**
- `[e.g., I start with customer interviews, then synthesize into problem statements]`
- `[e.g., I use the Opportunity Solution Tree framework]`

**Prioritization:**
- `[e.g., RICE scoring for features, MoSCoW for requirements within a feature]`
- `[e.g., I always validate priorities with engineering effort estimates before committing]`

**Shipping:**
- `[e.g., I write the PRD, review with eng lead, then share in design review before sprint planning]`
- `[e.g., I prefer phased launches: internal dogfood -> beta -> GA]`

**Retrospectives:**
- `[e.g., After every major launch, I write a brief "What we learned" doc]`

- [ ] Formatted for the target audience
- [ ] Spell-checked and jargon-free (or jargon explained)
- [ ] `[Add your own items here]`

### Before Sharing PRDs
- [ ] Engineering has reviewed feasibility
- [ ] Design has reviewed user flows
- [ ] Edge cases and error states covered
- [ ] `[Add your own items here]`

### Before Sharing Roadmaps
- [ ] Aligned with company/team OKRs
- [ ] Resource constraints reflected

## Tools & Integrations

List the tools you use so Claude can reference them and format output accordingly.

| Category            | Tool                        | Notes                                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Project Management  | `[e.g., Jira, Linear, Asana]` | `[e.g., We use epics > stories > subtasks]` |
| Design              | `[e.g., Figma]`             | `[e.g., Designers own the Figma, I comment]` |
| Analytics           | `[e.g., Amplitude, Mixpanel]` | `[e.g., I track funnels and retention]`    |
| Documentation       | `[e.g., Notion, Confluence]` | `[e.g., All PRDs live in Notion]`           |
| Communication       | `[e.g., Slack, Teams]`      | `[e.g., #product-updates for announcements]` |
| Roadmapping         | `[e.g., Productboard, Aha!]` | `[e.g., Source of truth for roadmap]`       |
| Research            | `[e.g., Dovetail, UserTesting]` | `[e.g., All interview notes go here]`   |

**Workflow integrations:**
- `[e.g., Jira tickets auto-link to Figma designs]`
- `[e.g., Slack bot posts weekly metrics every Monday]`
