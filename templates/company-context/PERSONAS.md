## How Personas Influence Decisions

### Prioritization
When evaluating features or initiatives, ask:
- Which persona does this serve?
- How many customers in this segment?
- What's the revenue impact for this persona?
- Does this address a top-3 pain point?

### Conflict Resolution
When personas have conflicting needs:
1. Default to the persona representing the largest revenue segment
2. Consider whether the feature is table-stakes for retention vs. nice-to-have
3. Evaluate effort-to-impact ratio for each persona
4. Check strategic priorities — does one persona align more closely with company direction?

### Communication
Tailor messaging, documentation, and support by persona:
- **Marketing:** Lead with the pain points and language specific to each persona
- **Sales:** Match the evaluation and purchase behavior of the persona
- **Product:** Design flows that match the tech savviness and goals of primary personas
- **Support:** Anticipate questions based on persona knowledge level
