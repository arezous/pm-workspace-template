# Executive Brief

> For leadership, board, and executive audiences.

## When to Use

- Board updates and investor communications
- Executive decision requests
- Quarterly business reviews
- Strategy proposals to leadership
- Any document where the reader has 5 minutes or less

## Structure

**BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)** — Lead with the conclusion or ask. Executives read top-down and may stop at any point.

1. **Bottom line** — One sentence: what you need or what happened
2. **Key points** — 3-5 bullets covering the essential facts
3. **Context** — Brief background (only what's needed to understand the ask)
4. **The ask** — Specific decision, resource, or action needed
5. **Timeline** — When this matters by

## Language Guidelines

- Business outcomes over feature descriptions
- Quantified impact: revenue, users, time saved, cost reduced
- Strategic context: how this connects to company goals
- Concrete numbers over vague qualifiers

## Tone

Confident, direct, action-oriented. Write like you respect their time.

## Avoid

- Technical jargon or implementation details
- Vague claims ("significant improvement", "many users")
- Walls of text or long paragraphs
- Passive voice
- Burying the ask at the end

## Examples

### Bad

> We've been working on improving the onboarding flow for the past quarter. The team has explored several approaches including redesigning the welcome screen, adding tooltips, and simplifying the signup form. After user testing with 12 participants, we found that the simplified form performed better. We think we should move forward with this approach and would like to get approval.

### Good

> **Ask:** Approve eng resources (2 devs, 3 weeks) to ship the simplified onboarding flow.
>
> **Why now:**
> - Current onboarding converts at 23% — below the 35% industry benchmark
> - Simplified flow tested at 41% conversion across 12 user sessions
> - Each 1% improvement = ~$140K ARR based on current traffic
>
> **Expected impact:** +18% conversion, ~$2.5M incremental ARR
>
> **Timeline:** Ship by March 15, measure for 2 weeks, full rollout by April 1
