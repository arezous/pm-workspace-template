> Building my operating system for AI-native product work

**Status:** v0.1 - First commit, basic structure in place

## What This Is

My personal workspace for doing product management with AI assistance (Terminal + Claude Code + Cursor).

This is a **work in progress**. I'm building it for myself and sharing it publicly as I go.

## Why I'm Building This

I believe every PM will become an AI-powered PM. This is my attempt to figure out what that looks like.

**Next:** Add PRD templates and automation scripts
